# FUTURE_CS_01
This repository contains the first task gievn to me by Future interns to complete which involved doing a vulnerability assesment report on a live public website. Ther website i had selected to do this report on is http://testphp.vulnweb.com. The scope of this assessment had included  passive and non intrusive testing only, manual inspection using browser developer tools, automated scanning using the tool OWASP ZAP and no exploitation or active attacks were performed.

Tools used were: OWASP ZAP, Google chrome developer tools and Canva
